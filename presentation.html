## .white[Monthly differences]

.panelset[
.panel[.panel-name[Summary]

This plot shows the monthly difference for wind speed.

&gt;The wind speed tends to be highest around the **summer months**.

&gt;The wind speed is the lowest around the **winter months**, particularly for 87-89 Grattan St and the Cnr of Leiscester and Pelham St. 

&gt;The wind is fairly consistent throughout the year for 141 and 121 Grattan St, which makes sense given they are so close.

## .white[Hourly differences]

.panelset[
.panel[.panel-name[Summary]

This plot shows the hourly difference for wind speed.

&gt; The wind speed peaks between **1pm and 2pm** for all locations.

## .white[Wind Speed per Day]

.panelset[
.panel[.panel-name[Summary]

This plot shows the days in the year when the wind speed was above average. 

&gt;This figure supports the previous plot as it clearly shows December (a summer month) as having the most days with above average wind across all locations. 

&gt; Another interesting observation is that windier days tend to occur consecutively (in bouts of 2-3 days).

## .white[Are different parts of the city windier than others?]



.panelset[
.panel[.panel-name[Summary]

This graph compares the average monthly wind speed for each location against the average yearly wind speed. To generate this graph we calculated the average yearly wind speed over the year for all locations, and then calculated the difference for each location and month.

&gt;The summer months are less windy and the winter months have the highest wind speeds.

&gt;The Cnr of Pelham and Leicester St and 87-89 Grattan St are the windiest areas over the year as they are consistently above the yearly average wind speed.

&gt;The Cnr of Swanston and Grattan has higher wind speeds in September and October

&gt;The most .white[**interesting**] insight was that the wind speed varies .white[**greatly**] in Grattan St.

## .white[**Why?**]


--

Since the sensors are so close, it is unlikely that wind speed would be affected by temperature. 

So if wind speed is not impacted by 🔥  then what?

We think the wind speed might be impacted by the location of 🌲  and buildings around Melbourne.

## .white[Why is the wind speed different?]



.panelset[
.panel[.panel-name[Summary]

As previously shown:

&gt; 87-89 Grattan St and the Cnr of Pelham and Leiscester St are windier than the other spots

Notice from the map:

&gt; The other spots are clustered together and sit in between two parks with lots of trees which could explain the lower wind speed.

&gt; 87-89 Grattan St and the Cnr of Pelham and Leiscester St have higher wind speeds and are relatively unprotected.
